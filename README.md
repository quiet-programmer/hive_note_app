## VNotes

<p>This is an old project I was working on when learning to use Hive, will start working on it full time and will be adding new features as soon as possible. 
[Quick Update: I am currently working on the Project Full Time to make sure users get the best out of the app.]</p>

<p> You can download the app from <a href='https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.viewus.v_notes'>Play Store Here</a></p>

<p> Any contribution will be accepted if it meets what is needed, Thanks. </p>
